# Analyzing Netflix Movies data

The objective of the project is to draw conclusions from data collected from various sources refered to Netflix movies. To achieve this, we extract data from TMDB, IMDB and Instagram and we organize it in an structured file.

The process involves data collection, data manipulation and validation to test the quality of the data and to put it in a user friendly form. We follow the concept of "Tidy data" in which each row corresponds to an example of the sample and every column to one specific variable.

The final analysis is guided with some key questions that in particular try to get insights about the characteristics of the best ranked Netflix movies. The conclusions try to get understanding about which kind of Netflix products are performing better and in which products Neflix has to improve.

Besides, an ad-hoc python package built on Pandas was developed to automatize data collection, data cleaning and data manipulation for further analysis (as Netflix release new content every week)
