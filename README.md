Personal projects


# 1. Covid-19
Exploratory analysis of the pandemic trend. We store the data in a DBMS (SQL Server), we explore both within the database as in a python script and we build a report in Tableau showing several interesting metrics to understand the pandemic at a glance.

Starting with a Netflix movies simple dataset i get data from another sources (TMDB, Instagram, IMDB) and i elaborate diverse metrics to understand which characteristics makes a high-rated movie and under what circumstances Netflix releases them.
### Competences showed:
- Web Scraping
- Exploratory data analysis/Data visualization
- Data wrangling
- Metric building
- Descriptive statistics
- OOP: develop ad-hoc programs, inheritance, polymorphism
- EDA


# 3. Statistics notebooks
Several notebooks i used while learning summary statistics, inferential statistics and probability

### 3.1. Hypothesis testing: click or not-click A/B test
In this simulated experiment, we try to discover if a modification in our company's advertisement can lead to an increase on its click-rate. We want to get an idea of how our new ad can increase the user's interest, and therefore increase the number of clicks.

To this reason, we simulate an ***A/B test*** in which 500 users are directed to the old ad (control group) and 500 users are directed to the new ad (test group). The test group will have a 48% click rate increase. We want to determine statistically whether that difference is due to chance or is statistically significant.
