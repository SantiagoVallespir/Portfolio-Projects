# Portfolio-Projects
Personal projects


# 1. Covid-19
We store covid data in a DBMS (SQL Server), we explore both within the database with sample Transact-SQL queries and we automate the actualization of the DB with new data.
### SQL competences showed:
- Build a DB
- Complex queries (CTE, Windows functions, views, joins, nested queries)
- Data modelling
### Python competences showed:
- Connect to a database
- Query the database
- Automate data loading into DB


# 2. Netflix movies Data Analysis project
Starting with a Netflix movies simple dataset i get data from another sources (TMDB, Instagram, IMDB) and i elaborate diverse metrics to understand which characteristics makes a high-rated movie and under what circumstances Netflix releases them.
### Competences showed:
- Web Scraping
- Exploratory data analysis/Data visualization
- Data wrangling
- Metric building
- Descriptive statistics
- OOP: develop ad-hoc programs, inheritance, polymorphism
- EDA


# 3. Statistics notebooks
Several notebooks i used while learning summary statistics, inferential statistics and probability

### 3.1. Hypothesis testing: click or not-click A/B test
In this simulated experiment, we try to discover if a modification in our company's advertisement can lead to an increase on its click-rate. We want to get an idea of how our new ad can increase the user's interest, and therefore increase the number of clicks.

To this reason, we simulate an ***A/B test*** in which 500 users are directed to the old ad (control group) and 500 users are directed to the new ad (test group). The test group will have a 48% click rate increase. We want to determine statistically whether that difference is due to chance or is statistically significant.

### 3.2. Descriptive statistics and probability.
In this notepad we try to get insigths about FIFA football international results from 1872 to 2022. The analysis is carried trying to answer the following questions:
- Is the number of goals increasing by match ever year?
- How total goals by match are distributed?
- What can we expect for next years?
- How frequently we can see a 10 or more goals match?
- How much we have to wait to see a 10 or more goals match?
- Home team is more likely to win?

#### Competences showed:
- EDA
- Probability distributions and modelling (Binomial, Poisson, Exponential)
- Bootstrapping
- Parameter Estimation
